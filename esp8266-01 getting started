while starting to esp01

if we use arduino (witout microcontroller) as ttl programmer
 *we have to provide direct connection
    1. TX  to TX
    2. RX to RX
    3. GPIO to GND
    4. RST  to VCC
   In arduino ide just select the esp module and left the settings as it is
   
   * If we use ardduino onboard power supply to power up the esp
      use 5V pin for RST 
          3.3v  for VCC
          
          ELSE u face error like espcomm_upload_memfailed     issue.
